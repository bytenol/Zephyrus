## Web 
- In your terminal, navigate to the web directory and install the required npm packages via the command `npm install`.
- Then run `npx vite` from the same directory.

**NOTE:** 
- You only need to run `npm install` after every new packages is added. most of the time you just need to run `npx vite`.
- You will be required to connect to the internet only when you want to run `npm install`. Every other part of the development can be done locally

## Native
- The native code uses c++20. Therefore you are expected to have a compiler that supports c++20 and modern cmake.
- You will also need to download and install [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) for your operating system.
